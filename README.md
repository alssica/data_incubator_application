# Project Proposal

For the cap stone project, I've proposed to analyze US corperate misconduct and accountability through datasets available at [GoodJobsFirst](https://www.goodjobsfirst.org/violation-tracker-data-sources), where they've been tracking court filing, government agency reports, and other public records for years. 

Preliminary analyses available in the  `/proposal` folder. You might find some graphs below entertaining:
